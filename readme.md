npm install ghpost-address
```

```js
const ghpost = require('ghpost-address')


ghpost.grabAddressInfo("AK-507-4460").then(function(res) {

  postCode: 'AK507',
  latLng: '6.669813,-1.561062' 
}

```

## API

```js
{ grabAddressInfo: [AsyncFunction] }

grabAddressInfo(address, options)


address can be PostCode, coodinates, Digital Address, Places


options is an object

{
	timeout: xxxxms
}


```

`options.timeout` is in milliseconds, optional and `10000ms` by default
